Please note: we are a chain store, which means that as of today, it does not have physical branches, so it is not possible to come and see the products and purchase on the spot.

Butâ€¦ (the reservations at the end of the answer) the coffee should be stored in a cool, dry place - the kitchen cabinet will do the job, after opening the package it should be stored in an airtight box - better Vacuum box for maximum freshness, with grinders and coffee and automatic espresso machines - the bean container is not an airtight box! Fill the desired amount for that moment only and store the rest in an airtight box.Regarding storage in the freezer, when storing coffee for a period of one month or more, storage in an airtight box (not a vacuum) in the freezer will extend the life of the coffee."

            content: "In an original package that has not been opened, a mixture of coffee beans will keep it fresh for several months to a year, depending on the quality of the package. Usually, the packaging of the coffee blends that come from abroad is more opaque and durable and will last longer. Close to a year. The difference between coffee beans that come in whole doubles and are ground just before cooking should also be considered, and ground coffee that arrives already after grinding.Fol coffee is easier to maintain freshness over time than ground coffee.",

            title: "How do you still maintain maximum freshness of the coffee bean mixture?",
            content: "First, do not use more than the amount you want at that moment, as the bean container in your machine will not be sealed and the beans that will remain in it will lose their freshness until the next preparation. Storage in general should preferably be in a vacuum box in a cool, dry place. Freezer storage is not recommended unless you are storing for a period of time and then putting it out for daily use. Once you have removed the mixture from the freezer, do not return it there because the freshness will be damaged."

In a quick calculation this means about 140 cups of coffee per pound of beans. We have built a special calculator that will help you make quick calculations regarding your coffee consumption.

The relative advantage of the capsules is convenience in terms of cleanliness and operation, the disadvantage of the capsules is a high price and often manufacturers' limitations - Nespresso coffee machines for example can only use original Nespresso capsules or Nespresso compatible coffee capsules , as well as Lavaza Amodo coffee machine- Miu, which can also be used only with original capsules or Amodo-Miu-compatible coffee capsules , etc. A non-capsule-based coffee machine will fit any blended coffee bean mixture`,

If the amount of coffee you drink per day exceeds 10 cups of espresso, we recommend purchasing the appropriate MZ espresso machine for a larger amount of cups.`,
